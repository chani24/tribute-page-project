Fela formed his first band and married in 1960 and married his first wife <strong>Remi Taylor</strong> in 1963. Fela
moved back to africa to continue his music and in 1969, Fela named his music, <strong>Afrobeat</strong>. In the 70s Fela's music and political
views began to change. He used his music to critisize the ruling government. He released an album, <strong>Zombie</strong> which described
the methods of the Nigerian army. It resulted in attacks on his kalakuta republic and the communes by the government
which in turn led to the death of his mother. He further infuriated the government by releasing more songs like <i>Coffin For Head of State</i>
and <i>unknown soldier</i>. His music continued to spread and he gained influence. He was arrested and beaten on several occasions, he slowed down music production and release
and it was then rumoured he was ill. on the 3<sup>rd</sup> August 1997, his brother, Olikoye Ransom-Kuti, announced his death from Kaposi's
sarcoma. A result of AIDS he suffered.</p>
